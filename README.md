# SPM - Learning Journey Planning System (LJPS)

With the inadequacy of LMS (Learning Management System), LJPS was built. LJPS is an online planning web based platform that enable employees to have a personal learning journmey tracker that could guide them on the courses they could take either from the LMS or in physical classes to prepare them for the next position or in a different area within the organisation.

The system would allow staff to set their learning goal by setting on a position that they are working towards. The system will then list out the skills required for those positions and the courses (internal/external) that correspond to those skills. They are then able to view the details of those courses. They are then able to add those courses to theri learning journey.
